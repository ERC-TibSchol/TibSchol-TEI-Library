# TibSchol digital library of textual fragments

This repository contains the digital library of annotated textual fragments in TEI format. It was created in the framework of the project *The Dawn of Tibetan Buddhist Scholasticism (11th-13th c.) (TibSchol).* Cf. [https://www.oeaw.ac.at/ikga/tibschol](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/projects/tibschol/home) for more information.

This project, hosted at the Institute for Cultural and Intellectual History of Asia of the Austrian Academy of Sciences <https://www.oeaw.ac.at/ikga>, has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No. 101001002). See <https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101001002>. 

The project's database (<https://tibschol.acdh-ch-dev.oeaw.ac.at/>) contains metadata on relevant Persons, Works, Instances and Places, and on the relations between them, which are supported by primary or secondary sources. For an overview of the project's data model see <https://erc-tibschol.github.io/datamodel/>.

Each TEI file is related to a Work, of which there may be one or several instances that also qualify as primary source for relations.
The <teiHeader> contains information about the file, as well as information, extracted from the database, about the Work, its instance(s), and author.
The <text> part of the document contains textual excerpts from this work, with or without gap between them.
